            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to
                include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. </p><img class="image"

            <p>C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and
                even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of
                both C and C++ are the same. </p>
            <h1><u>Some interesting facts about C++</u></h1>
            <P>Here are some awesome facts about C++ that may interest you:</P>
            <ol>
                <li>The name of C++ signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. “++” is the C increment
                    operator.</li>
                <li>C++ is one of the predominant languages for the development of all kind of technical and commercial
                    software.</li>
                <li>C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the
                    four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.</li>
                <li>C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language.</li>
                <li>A function is a minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.(at least main() function)</li>
            </OL>

            <header>C++ Programming Basics</header>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It
                has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like
                Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.</p>
            <p>Before explaining the basics of C++ , I would like to clarify two more ideas: low level and high level.
                To make it easy to understand, let’s consider this scenario – when we go to Google search engine and
                search for some queries, Google displays us some websites according to our question. Google does this
                for us at a very high level. We don’t know what’s happening at the low level until we look into Google
                servers (at a low level) and further to the level where the data is in the form of 0s/1s. The point I
                want to make here is that low level means nearest to the hardware, and a high level means farther from
                the hardware with a lot of layers of abstraction. C ++ is considered as low level language as it is
                closer to hardware than most general – purpose programming languages.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="C++_Data_Types">
            <header>C++ Data Types</header>

            <p>All variables use data type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we
                can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data they can store. Whenever a
                variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type
                with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.</p>
            <p>C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the
                needs of the application. Data types specify the size and types of values to be stored. However, storage
                representation and machine instructions to manipulate each data type differ from machine to machine,
                although C++ instructions are identical on all machines.</p>
            <b><u>C++ supports the following data types: </u> </b>
            <ol>
                <li>Primary or Built-in or Fundamental data type</li>
                <li>Derived data types</li>
                <li>User-defined data types</li>

            <header>C++ Variables</header>

            <p>Variables in C++ is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.</li>
                <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable
                    effects that memory location.</li>
                <li>n C++, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
                <p><b><u>How to Declare Variables?</u></b></p>
                <p>A typical variable declaration is of the form:</p>
                <code class="syntax">
// Declaring a single variable
type variable_name;
// Declaring multiple variables:
type variable1_name, variable2_name,..;

        <section class="main-section" id="C++_Loops">
            <header>C++ Loops</header>
            <p>In programming, sometimes there is a need to perform some operation more than once or (say) n number of
                times. Loops come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements.</p>
            <p><u>For example</u> : Suppose we want to print “Zufiya Idrisi” 5 times. This can be done in two ways as
                shown below:</p>
            <u><b>Manual Method (Iterative Method)</b></u>
            <code class="syntax">
            #include iostream
            using namespace std;                 
            int main()
            {
            cout << "Zufiya Idrisi\n";
            cout << "Zufiya Idrisi\n";
            cout << "Zufiya Idrisi\n";
            cout << "Zufiya Idrisi\n";
            cout << "Zufiya Idrisi\n";
            return 0;

            <header>Arrays in C++</header>
            <p>An array in C++ or be it in any programming language is a collection of similar data items stored at
                contiguous memory locations and elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array. They can be
                used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, float, double, char, etc of any
                particular type. To add to it, an array in C/C++ can store derived data types such as structures,
                pointers etc. Given below is the picture representation of an array.</p>
            <b><u>Why do we need arrays? </u></b>
            <p>We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects, but if we want to
                store a large number of instances, it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea
                of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.</p>
            <i>Array</i>
            <ol>
                <li>It is a group of variables of similar data types referred to by a single element.</li>
                <li>Its elements are stored in a contiguous memory location.</li>
                <li>The size of the array should be mentioned while declaring it.</li>
                <li>Array elements are always counted from zero (0) onward.</li>
                <li>Array elements can be accessed using the position of the element in the array.</li>
                <li>The array can have one or more dimensions.</li>

            <p>A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. The
                idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of
                writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.</p>
            <p>In simple terms, a function is a block of code that only runs when it is called.</p>

            <u><b>Types of Functions</b></u>
            <b><u>User Defined Function</u></b>
            <p>User Defined functions are user/customer-defined blocks of code specially customized to reduce the
                complexity of big programs. They are also commonly known as “tailor-made functions” which are built only
                to satisfy the condition in which the user is facing issues meanwhile reducing the complexity of the
                whole program.</p>
            <b><u>Library Function</u></b>
            <p>Library functions are also called “builtin Functions“. These functions are a part of a compiler package
                that is already defined and consists of a special function with special and different meanings. Builtin
                Function gives us an edge as we can directly use them without defining them whereas in the user-defined
                function we have to declare and define a function before using them. <br>

        <section class="main-section" id="Object_Oriented_Programming_in_C++">
            <header>Object Oriented Programming in C++</header>
            <img class="image" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/OOPs-Concepts.jpg" alt=""><br>
            <br>
            <b><u>Characteristics of an Programming language</u></b> <br><br>
            <b><u>Class</u></b>
            <p>The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data
                type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating
                an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.</p>
            <b><u>Object</u></b>
            <p>An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an instance of
                a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is
                created) memory is allocated.</p>
            <b><u>Encapsulation</u></b>
            <P>In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In
                Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions
                that manipulate them.</P>
            <p>Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the
                accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the financial
                transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles
                all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular
                month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first
                have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular
                data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can
                manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”.</p>
            <b><u>Abstraction</u></b>
            <p> Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in
                C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction
                refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the
                background details or implementation.</p>
            <p>Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators
                will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how
                on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of
                the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.</p>
            <b><u>Polymorphism</u></b>
            <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability
                of a message to be displayed in more than one form.</p>
            <p>A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a
                husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations. This is
                called polymorphism.</p>
            <b><u>C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Operator Overloading</u> : The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviours in
                    different instances is known as operator overloading.</li>
                <li><u>Function Overloading</u> : Function overloading is using a single function name to perform
                    different types of tasks.
                    Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.</li>
            </ul>
            <b><u>Inheritance</u></b>
            <p>The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called
                Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Sub Class</u>: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or
                    Derived Class.</li>
                <li><u>Super Class</u>:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or
                    Super class.</li>
                <li><u>Reusability</u>: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a
                    new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive
                    our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the
                    existing class.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Dynamic Binding</u>: In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is
                decided at runtime. C++ has virtual functions to support thi</p>
            <p><u>Message Passing</u>: Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each
                other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a
                function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing involves specifying
                the name of the object, the name of the function and the information to be sent.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Exception_Handling_in_C++">
            <header>Exception Handling in C++</header>
            <p>One of the advantages of C++ over C is Exception Handling. Exceptions are runtime anomalies or abnormal
                conditions that a program encounters during its execution. There are two types of exceptions:
                a)Synchronous, b)Asynchronous (i.e., exceptions which are beyond the program’s control, such as disc
                failure, keyboard interrupts etc.). C++ provides the following specialized keywords for this purpose:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>try</u>: Represents a block of code that can throw an exception.</li>
                <li><u>catch</u>: Represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.
