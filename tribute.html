        <p id="para">Savitribai Jyotirao Phule (3 January 1831 – 10 March 1897) was an Indian social reformer,
            educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. Along with her husband, in Maharashtra, she played an important
            and vital role in improving women's rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist
            movement. Savitribai and her husband founded one of the first modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide
            wada in 1848.[a] She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and
            gender. Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 in the village of Naigaon in Satara District,
            Maharashtra. Her birthplace was about fifteen km (9.3 mi) from Shirval and about 50 km (31 mi) from Pune.
            Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and Khandoji Nevase Patil, both of whom belonged to
            the Mali Community. She had three siblings. Savitribai was married to her husband Jyotirao Phule at the age
            of 9 or 10 (he was 13). Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of their own. It is said that they adopted
            Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support
            this. It is said when Yashwant was about to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he
            was born to a widow. Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's
            daughter in February 1889.
